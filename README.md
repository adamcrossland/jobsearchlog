# Job Search Log

This is a simple utility to help folks who are looking for a new job keep track of the positions to which they've applied.

I created this during a recent job search during which I needed to apply for unemployment insurance, and part of that process involved reporting on my job-seeking activities.

It stores all of its data in the browser's *localStorage*, so there is no server component, and no data goes anywhere. Secure. Private. Nice.
